Dear sir,

I trust this note finds you well. Attached is my frontend and backend code for the mySQL to-do-list  Problem stement. Each element has been carefully structured as per the design specifications. I have included comments within the react as well as in node for clarity and easy understanding. Your feedback on the structure and overall user experience is highly appreciated.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
[Darpan Saini]
